Question 3 Answer

    The stream pipeline for List<Employee> contains different operations,
 intermediate and terminal operations. 
    First, we call the method stream to enable us to use its methods.
 Then, for the intermediate operations, we used the operation filter to generate
 a new stream according to the specified condition and to give a new number of stream objects.
 After that, we used the map operation to map a new value to every object of the new stream 
 that generated after the filter operation.
 Then, for the terminal operations, we used the method groupingBy to classify the objects
 in the stream by their departments and to calculate the number of the objects in that group.
 Then we used collect operation to create a new collection of objects that were created from
 the method groupingBy. Finally, we used forEach operation to perform the operations on
 every key-value pair in the stream.
